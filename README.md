# Pillow
[![test](https://github.com/mayant15/pillow/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/mayant15/pillow/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Pillow is a project to learn about compilers. It is a simple language and a compiler frontend that generates LLVM IR. Still very much a work in progress.

## Dependencies
- An LLVM 10.0 installation, pointed to by `LLVM_SYS_100_PREFIX`, required by the `llvm-sys` crate. [More info](https://crates.io/crates/llvm-sys).
